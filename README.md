# Basics

This is python script that reads `/sys` and `/proc` (or similar). It is made for Raspberry Pi OS, but should work similarly on other Linux OS's. It takes the values from the files and graphs them overtime. There are different graph and system variables that can be edited, it is explained when ran. These variables are stored in the `values` dictionary for easy access.

      Many elifs in series
      
      Else/Base case (floats in 'values' dictionary)

## Settings ("settings.txt" by default)

Formated like how you change the values in the program, with ": " seperating key and value. And each line being a new key-value pair.

<pre style="overflow-x: scroll;">
  [Key]: [Val]
</pre>

EX:

<pre style="overflow-x: scroll;">
  barChr: |
  bArmIn: 0.9haksd [Taken as "barMin: 0.9"]
</pre>

## Log ("log.txt" by default)

<pre style="overflow-x: scroll;">
  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS in "Path": ###
</pre>

EX:

<pre style="overflow-x: scroll;">
   2025-03-25 3:34:51 in "/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp": 95.32
   2025-03-25 18:35:06 in "/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp": -1.0
</pre>

</pre>

# Method

`values['method']` and `values['methodInfo']` tells the script how to read files. `values['method']` is a float passed into a function, changed to an interger, and then compared with many elif's. This causes different behaviors. `values['methodInfo']` is a list of strings that stores data needed for handling each method.

## Each Method:

| Method | Description | Equation | methodInfo | For |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | --- |
| 0 | Raw: Reads one line, converts string to float | N/A | [line] | Thermal, Memory |
| 1 | Reads a single line of a cumulated value, and finds rate of change | out = (new - old) / `values['spf']` | [line, old] | Network |
| 2 | Reads a line and breaks it into a list, sums the list for total and takes a position for another value | total = ((newTotal - oldTotal) / `values['spf']`), val = ((newVal - oldVal) / `values['spf']`), out = (total - val) / total | [line, valPos, oldTotal, oldVal] | CPU Load |
| 3 | Similar to method 2 in structure, although only outputs a single value similar to method 1 | out = (new - old) / `values['spf']` | [line, valPos, oldVal] | Disk
